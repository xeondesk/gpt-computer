Troubleshooting
---------------

For mac and linux system, there are sometimes slim python installations that do not include the ``gpt-computer`` requirement tkinter, which is a standard library and thus not pip installable.

To install tkinter on mac, you can for example use brew:

.. code-block:: console

    $ brew install python-tk

On debian-based linux systems you can use:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
